Principles
* Markers and Trails for Permanent, Replayable content only, no achievements or collections 
* Aim to provide smooth trails by:
   * avoiding un-necessary combat
   * minimising terrain obstacles, like bushes, rocks or trees
   * minimising the need to adjust the camera
   * why jump when you can walk
